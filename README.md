Hey! Welcome to the Horizon front end!

DISCLAIMER:
Before we start, please be understanding with me at this moment. This is my first front-end project, and I've only created some web2 applications in a training course. Generally speaking, front end is new to me.

So, let's get to it!

## 1.2 What it does

This application was developed to embody the Protocol's functionality. As the Protocol aims to facilitate access to credit, we also need to enhance the experience. For this, we use embed wallets, allowing login via email or social. Through this dApp, we perform the following actions:

### 1.2.1 For the staff

- Creation of Consortium Titles
- Maintenance of Deadlines

### 1.2.2 For the user

- Purchase of Consórcio Title Quotas
- Payment of Installments
- Allocation of Guarantees
  - RWA
  - Consórcio Title Quotas
- Withdrawal of the invested amount.

## 1.3 How it was built

Due to the limited time available for creation, which was less than 5 days, and the technical limitation mentioned at the beginning of this document, I had to skip steps. Therefore, the entire application layout was conceived while it was being developed.

## 1.4 Its purpose

The purpose of this application is to make the interaction with Horizon's Smart Contracts user-friendly.

## 1.5 Tools used

- React
- NextJs
- Third Web
- Styling
  - DaisyUi
  - tailwind CSS
